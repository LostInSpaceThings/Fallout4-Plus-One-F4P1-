# Fallout 4 Plus One (F4P1) Modpack
**A brand new modpack, giving a refreshing expierience to your Fallout 4 game in 2026.**

Personally, I love all the mods and modpacks we already have. However, I feel like most of them are outdated, and could be updated. This is my attempt at making something new - all while bringing in content every modpack should have. 

_So, what's here_

Like i said, this modpack contains all the important stuff, while bringing new content other modpacks might not have. Here are some notable mods:

- **20 Leagues Under The Sea**  - A brand new vault to explore.
- **APC Mobile Base** - Get yourself a mobile base, and command the commonwealth.
- **Loads of new creatures** - Uses mods like DECAY, Rad Spiders, Remnnants, and more.
- **Overhauls cities, buildings, and interiors.** - some of our mods include Nai Goodneighbor, Beantown Interiors, and new player homes.

The total mods in this pack are over 100, allowing you hundreds of hours in addition to what it already has. We try to hit every aspect of the game, including:

- More Immersion
- Improved Audio and Reverb
- Important Patches
- Updated Graphics and Textures
- Visual Improvements
- Improvements to Ammo Crafting, new weapons, and more.
- New Lands to explore, as well as brand new quests.

# Personal Customizable Options

This modpack includes MCM, allowing you to customize some of the mods it has. You can leave it, or change it. We use NAC for weathers, it will guide you on first load.
We also have a survival mod, feel free to customize it. It's basically there to bring those features from 76 tom Fallout 4.

# Can I Use ENB?

Absolutely. Which one you choose is up to you, but we recommend Dawn ENB.
